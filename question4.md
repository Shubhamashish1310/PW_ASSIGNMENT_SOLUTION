###Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?

###Tag:-
>>HTML uses a system of "tags" to define the structure and layout of web pages. Tags are the building blocks of 
HTML documents and consist of angle brackets enclosing specific keywords. These tags provide instructions 
to web browsers on how to display the content.


>>An HTML tag is composed of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. The opening tag starts with 
the less-than symbol (<), followed by the tag name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing 
tag is similar, but it also includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name

some examples of tags:- Paired tags - <html>, <head>, <p>, <div> etc
single tags - <img/>, <input/>, <br/>, and <meta/> etc.

###ELEMENTS:--
-HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. HTML elements consist of a start tag, an end 
tag (if applicable), and content in between the tags. The start tag defines the beginning of an HTML 
element, and the end tag defines the end of an HTML element.


-Each HTML element has a specific structure that defines its behaviour and appearance on a web page. 
Here is a breakdown of the anatomy of an HTML element

<h1>THIS IS CONTENT</h1> this whole is a Element and <h1> is tag
