### Ques2 Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document?

- Comments are useful when you want to write something about the code but you do not want to run that 
or show in the output.

- Comments are basically for humans, you write comments for your future self or for other developers who 
might work on the same codebase.

- In HTML we can create a comment as shown below and the browser will not display that on the screen.This means that they are not displayed on the page when it is rendered. However, they are still visible to anyone who views the page source code.


#### Example to create comment :
<!--your comment-->

<!-- This is a comment.-->
##### single  line comments
<body>
<!--this is multiline 
comment as you can see --> </body>
##### multi line comments



  ### Example of comments : 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
        <!--This is single line comment,It wont be displayed by the browser -->
        <h2>This is single line comment</h2>
         <!-- This is
         multi-line
         comment -->
         <h2>This is multi-line comment</h2>
         </comment>
         <h2>This is a comment using</h2>
         </body>
