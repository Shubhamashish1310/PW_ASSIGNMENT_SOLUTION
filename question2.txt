Ques2] Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document?

Comments are basically for humans, you write comments for your future self or for other developers who 
might work on the same codebase.

<!- - This is a comment. - - >

<!- - This is a comment

  This can be a multi line as well -- >

<h2>Multi line comments</h2
