What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

>>The DOCTYPE declaration is the first line of an HTML document. It tells the browser which version of HTML the document is using.
This is important because the browser can then use this information to render the document correctly.

The DOCTYPE declaration is not required, but it is good practice to include it. 
This is because it helps to ensure that your document will be rendered correctly on all browsers.
